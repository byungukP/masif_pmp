	abstract = {Predicting protein-membrane interactions is a formidable challenge due to the subtle physicochemical features that distinguish membrane-binding regions of a protein surface, as well as the scarcity of experimentally resolved membrane-bound protein conformations. Here, we present MaSIF-PMP, a geometric deep learning model that leverages molecular surface fingerprints to predict interfacial binding sites (IBSs) of peripheral membrane proteins (PMPs). MaSIF-PMP integrates geometric and chemical surface features to produce spatially resolved IBS predictions. Compared to existing models, MaSIF-PMP achieves superior performance for IBS classification, while feature ablation studies and transfer learning analyses reveal distinct determinants governing protein-membrane versus protein-protein interactions. We further show that molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can validate model predictions, refine IBS labels, and capture composition-dependent membrane binding patterns. These results establish MaSIF-PMP as an effective framework for IBS prediction and highlight the potential of incorporating conformational dynamics from MD to improve both model accuracy and biological interpretability.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.U.S. National Science Foundation, https://ror.org/021nxhr62, 2346683},
