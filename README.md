# MaSIF-PMP

MaSIF-PMP is a method for predicting membrane-binding interfaces — referred to as interfacial binding sites (IBSs) — of proteins, based on spatially varying geometric and chemical features computed across protein surfaces. It is built upon the prior framework [MaSIF](https://github.com/LPDI-EPFL/masif), which uses molecular surface fingerprints to predict protein–protein interactions. This project includes code adapted from the original MaSIF implementation, licensed under the Apache 2.0. This repository contains the code and resources for reproducing the experiments presented in:

B. Park and R. C. Van Lehn*. (2025). Decoding protein-membrane binding interfaces from surface-fingerprint-based geometric deep learning and molecular dynamics simulations. *bioRxiv*. https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.14.682447.

## Quick try
The easiest way of try out MaSIF-PMP is through the prebuilt Docker container:
```text
docker pull byungukp/masif_pmp:main
```

Start an interactive session:
```text
docker run -it byungukp/masif_pmp:main
```
To fully utilize the GPU for model retraining and mount a local directory into the container:
```text
docker run -it --gpus all -v ${LOCAL_DIR_PATH}:${MOUNT_PATH} \
               --rm byungukp/masif_pmp:main
```

After starting an interactive session, update the repository to ensure you have the latest version (in case the Docker image is not up to date), and go into the MaSIF-PMP data directory:
```text
root@99eb41f87063:/masif_pmp# git pull
root@99eb41f87063:/masif_pmp# cd data
```

A complete list of dependencies with their versions is provided in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

Alternatively, you can use the prebuilt Docker container (see [Quick try](#Quick-try)) or build your own image using the provided [Dockerfile](Dockerfile), which offers the simplest setup.


## Installation
After installing the required dependencies, add the following environment variables to your path (updating the directories as appropriate):
```sh
export PYMESH_PATH=/path/to/PyMesh
export MSMS_BIN=/path/to/msms
export APBS_BIN=/path/to/apbs
export MULTIVALUE_BIN=/path/to/multivalue
export PDB2PQR_BIN=/path/to/pdb2pqr.py
```
Then, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/byungukP/masif_pmp.git
cd masif_pmp/
```

## Usage
The `masif-pmp/data/` directory contains scripts for training and prediction using MaSIF-PMP, while `masif-pmp/source/` includes the model source code.
The `masif-pmp/analysis/` and `masif-pmp/benchmark/` directories contain scripts and datasets for reproducing the results presented in the [MaSIF-PMP](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.14.682447) study.


### Model Parameters
[masif_opts.py](source/default_config/masif_opts.py) defines the parameters used for data preprocessing, training, and prediction.
Users can adjust these parameters as needed for their specific purposes.
A detailed description of each parameter is provided in the subsections below.

### Data Preprocessing
MaSIF-PMP takes as input numerical arrays representing patch information, surface features, and polar coordinates that are preprocessed from protein surface files.
Therefore, data preprocessing must be performed before executing training or prediction.
You can generate mesh files and precompute the corresponding input feature arrays from either a protein structure obtained from the RCSB PDB or a custom structure.

The argument `PDB_CHAIN` specifies the PDB ID and chain, separated by an underscore
(*e.g.*, perforin C2 domain, PDB ID 4Y1T, chain A → 4Y1T_A).

```sh
cd data

# For a protein structure downloaded from the PDB
./data_prepare_one.sh PDB_CHAIN

# For a custom protein structure
# Update the path as appropriate
./data_prepare_one.sh --file /path/to/custom_structure.pdb PDB_CHAIN
```

To preprocess a list of proteins, create a text file containing the desired PDB_CHAIN IDs,
edit `data_prepare_all.sh` to use this file as input, and run:

```sh
./data_prepare_all.sh
```

By default, as defined in [masif_opts.py](source/default_config/masif_opts.py), all preprocessed and precomputed files are saved under `data/data_preparation/`:
- Raw PDB files downloaded from the RCSB PDB (or custom `.pdb` files): `data/data_preparation/00-raw_pdbs/`
- Extracted chain PDB files: `data/data_preparation/01-benchmark_pdbs/`
- Mesh files (optionally colored by ground-truth IBS labels if `masif_opts["compute_ibs"] = True`): `data/data_preparation/01-benchmark_surfaces/`
- Precomputed input features: `data/data_preparation/04a-precomputation_9A/precomputation/`


### Prediction
The input can be provided as either a single PDB chain ID or as a list of IDs in a .txt file.
After data preprocessing, the model takes the processed input and generates predictions for the corresponding protein surface.


```sh
# For a single PDB_CHAIN ID
./predict_ibs.sh PDB_CHAIN
./color_ibs.sh PDB_CHAIN

# For multiple PDB_CHAIN IDs
./predict_ibs.sh -l lists/id_list.txt
./color_ibs.sh -l lists/id_list.txt
```

Prediction scores and mesh files colored by the predicted scores are saved in:
- `data/output/all_feat_3l/pred_data/` (prediction scores)
- `data/output/all_feat_3l/pred_surfaces/` (colored mesh files)


### Reproducing Test Set Predictions
To reproduce the predictions on the test set, run the following command:
```sh
./reproduce_pmp_ibs.sh
```

### Retraining
The dataset path for IBS labels is defined in [masif_opts["pmp_dataset"]](source/default_config/masif_opts.py).
Users may replace this path with a custom dataset, but the file must include the following columns:
cathpdb, pdb, residue_name, IBS, chain_id, and residue_number.
Refer to the provided [CSV file](data/lists/pmp_dataset.csv) for the required format.

To train the model, modify [custom_params.py](data/nn_models/all_feat_3l/custom_params.py)
 (*e.g.*, update `custom_params["training_list"]`), move the file to the working directory, and then run:

```sh
./train_nn.sh custom_params.py
```

The best-performing model from the training process will be saved in the directory specified by `custom_params["model_dir"]`.


### Surface Visualization
